# The Broumov Guide 🚶

Welcome to the repository of [The Broumov Guide](https://pruvodcebroumovem.cz) 🎉. This project invites you on a nostalgic stroll through Broumov as it was at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries 🕰️. Get ready to encounter remnants of the architectural and urban sensitivity from the builders of the town during this era 🏛️. Families like Schroll, Dimter, Nowotný, Meier, Pollack, and others significantly contributed to the city's development, flourishing chiefly due to the wealth generated by the thriving textile industry at the time 🏭.

Many of the original forms of the villas have not been preserved, as well as some residential and industrial buildings 🏚️. Some structures were completely demolished, while others lost their charm to the ravages of time, insufficient care, or insensitive construction interventions 🚧. Only a few buildings have been renovated to regain their charm 🛠️. The villas were often accompanied by gardens with gazebos and orangeries, which now, although modernized, are mostly publicly accessible as part of the urban greenery and still hold some of their original charm 🌳.

### Technology Stack 🛠️

The Broumov Guide is built using modern web technologies to provide a seamless user experience. The core framework utilized is Astro, which enables fast, modern websites with less effort. For interactive elements, AlpineJS is employed to handle reactive and declarative rendering, while TailwindCSS is utilized for styling, ensuring a clean and responsive design across various devices.

The creation of the Broumov historical architecture and urbanism guide was a collective effort involving:
- Students of Gymnázium Broumov, with texts based on materials provided by the State District Archive of Náchod, the Museum of Broumov and the Broumov City Library.
- The Institute of Regional Memory of Broumov for postcard reproductions and text supplements.
- DDM Ulita Broumov for current photography and printing.

This project was part of the Langerova zahrada project in 2017 under the program PRB o.p.s We Love Broumovsko. In 2022, The Broumov Guide was expanded and updated to its current form as part of the 30 Years Together project, thanks to the financial support from the European Union.
